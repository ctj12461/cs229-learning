\begin{answer}
	$$
	g(\eta) = \mathrm E[T(y);\eta] = \mathrm E[y;\eta]
	$$
	
	Since $y$ is distributed to the Poisson distribution with a parameter $\lambda=e^\eta$,
	
	$$
	g(\eta) = \mathrm E(y; \eta) = \lambda = e^\eta
	$$
	
	So $g(\eta)$ is the canonical response function for the family.
\end{answer}
