\begin{answer}
	After adding the $L_2$ regularization, the derivative of $J(\theta)$ with respect to $\theta_0$ is
	
	$$
	\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_0} J(\theta) = \sum_{i = 1}^{m} (h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}) + \theta_0
	$$
	
	If $\theta_0 = 0$, $\sum_{i = 1}^{m} h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{m} y^{(i)}$, and the conclusion we get in (a) is still correct.
	
	Otherwise, the property no longer holds true for the logistic regression when $(a,b)=(0,1)$.
